## Hi, I'm Lenz

I'm a web mechanic since the early days and do internet related stuff
for a living. Some of you might have seen me as your internet guy back
in the 90's in Voralberg which happens to be a nice spot in the very
western part of Austria.

Some of you might know me as the CTO of united-domains - a domain
registrar located in Starnberg, Germany - stuff I did during the first
part of the 200x's.

Some of you might know me as the guy hanging out at every geek event in
Wellington, New Zealand where I live since some years.

Finally some may know me as one of the crazy guys who started
yet another domain registrar as if there would not be thousands of them
already. That registrar is called iWantMyName and is my main venture in
the moment.
