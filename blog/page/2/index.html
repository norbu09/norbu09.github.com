  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Three new destination markets in some months</h1>

<p>It&#8217;s been a bit of a busy time lately as we launched three new platforms
in the last time and that brought with it a lot of challenges.
Fortunately it also pushed me to complete our migration to our new
backend which is now entirely message driven and based only on the
finest stuff one finds in the moment.</p>

<p>The backend engine is <a href="http://rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a> based and persists messages to
<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> if necessary. We have a simple home grown workflow engine
that enables us to easily customise and change flows like what happens
if a domain gets registered or exactly when we charge a user. I spoke
about an early version of this workflow engine last year at the erlounge
Wellington
(http://norbu09.org/2009/10/15/one-system-to-rule-them-all.html). This
backend engine is a scalable hub for tasks and the main challenge was to
make our frontend stupid simple and more or less only a wrapper for
tasks happening in the backend. We have now nearly all the logic moved
and the frontend is quite slim, holding only the e-commerce and user
profile functionality whereas all the domain specific functionality
moved out.</p>

<p>The next step was to make our frontend not only simple but also
brandable and multi currency/language. This is the moment where you
notice that strings are everywhere and solid internal APIs pay off big
time. This challenge was a big one but we managed to master it and have
now an <a href="http://iWantMyName.com">English</a>, <a href="http://meinName.com">German</a> and <a href="http://benikvrij.nl">Dutch</a> version online selling
in USD, EUR and <a href="http://iWantMyName.co.nz">NZD</a>. The frontend is a generic one that has many
configuration knobs that can tweak the functionality but it is still
only one code base for all projects. The template sets are separate so
each language has its own template set. The two English speaking
platforms share a template set but have different currencies - the
content however is not 100% the same on the two. All this needs lots of
config variables to check against and Template::Toolkit was a big help
here.</p>

<p>As you can see there went a lot of effort into designing a flexible
system that can act in different environments and still be only
one system. Most of the content is now served out of CouchDB and we
further reduced the amount of data stored in PostgreSQL as well as hard
coded texts in templates. We rewrote our shopping card from scratch and
the checkout process is really simple now as most of the heavy lifting
is now in the backend. Stuff we are working on in the moment is Session
handling and user management in CouchDB with a goal to strip out
PostgreSQL entirely (the according Catalyst::Plugins are on the way).
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, we love PostgreSQL but there is no need for it
anymore once we have the remaining things ported over to CouchDB. It
simplifies our stack and reduces our admin overhead.</p>

<p>Speaking of admin overhead - we also run all setups (including local
development VMs) off a puppet setup and code/template/CouchDB rollout is
done via capistrano which turns out to work quite well with catalyst and
perl. We roll out a new frontend webserver in about half an hour
from bare debian to running frontend with the most time being spent
waiting for puppet and no manual step other then installing puppet.</p>

<p>You see we have been busy, if you find bugs, report them. We know that
the performance in the DNS editor is still crap but we try to sort that
and there are some rough edges here and there but most of the platforms
should run smoothly. It was a steep learning curve once again but we
managed to create a scalable system that is extremely flexible and fast.</p>

<p>&#8230; hope you like it &#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Django like URL mapping in Catalyst - kind of</p>

<p>The problem I tried to solve is trivial, at least that was what I
thought. I tried to remap URLs in one of our platforms to make it easy
for others to adapt the way we call things. I18N related mostly. I have
most of the things that might change in central config file already but
figuring out how I actually get the URL map in there took a while. I
finally found <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/calendar/2008/11">
this post from Matt Trout</a> where he outlines several possibilities to
tackle it. Facing lack of time and knowing that the mapping is done by
others ;-) I went with the verbose version. It fits quite nicely in our
way of deploying Catalyst apps with local config files that change
behaviour of the platform.</p>

<p>In your central config file (MyApp.conf) put a snippet like this:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='xml'>&lt;Controller Editor&gt;
  &lt;action index&gt;
    Path        /vim
  &lt;/action&gt;
  &lt;action content&gt;
    Path        /vim/content
  &lt;/action&gt;
  &lt;action tld&gt;
    Path        /vim/tld
  &lt;/action&gt;
&lt;/Controller&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This maps the controller <code>Editor</code> to the path <code>/vim</code> and the two actions
( content and tlds ) to the according endpoints under it. This stupid
snippet cost me a couple of hours to figure out but now live is good and
I can move on :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Simple ssh tunnel script</h1>

<p>When replicating CouchDB you need either VPN oder authentication or
simply a SSH tunnel. No big deal normally a simple <code>ssh -L...</code> does the
trick but I ended up with those SSH sessions that blocked ports and hung
around and it was not the way to go in terms of automating rollouts
where you need that port once and then never again.</p>

<p>A bit of googling brought up a script of the <a href="http://wiki.bacula.org/doku.php?id=sshtunnel">
bacula guys</a> that had the same problem and I adopted their script a
bit to fit my needs. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>#!/bin/sh
# Establishes a self-killing SSH tunnel to the
# given SSH server, and forwards the correct
# ports for couchdb usage.

USER=[YOUR USER HERE]
HOME=$(grep &quot;^$USER:&quot; /etc/passwd | cut -d : -f 6)
CLIENT=$1
SSH=/usr/bin/ssh
DESTPORT=5985

echo &quot;Starting SSH-tunnel to $CLIENT...&quot;
# -f means: go into background
# -C means: use compression
# -2 means: only use SSH2
# -L 5985:localhost:5984 means: when forward 5985 to destination:5984
# sleep 60 is a simple command that will execute on the server and does
# nothing for 60 seconds,
# then it exits. This keeps ssh running for 60 seconds. Once we connect
# to the FD, that
# connection will keep ssh running even beyond the 60 seconds.
# Using this approach, we do not need to tear down the tunnel later, it
# disconnects itself
# automagically.
${SSH} -fC2 -L ${DESTPORT}:localhost:5984 ${CLIENT} sleep 60 &gt;/dev/null
2&gt;/dev/null
# give ssh a little time to establish the connection.
sleep 10</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Put it in a file called <code>sshtunnel</code> and make it executable. Usage is as
simple as <code>./sshtunnel user@host</code> or without the user if it is the same
you are using in the <code>$USER</code> variable.</p>
</div>

<h2>git via HTTP with nginx</h2>

<p>Just in case you don&#8217;t know (very unlikely) or never played with nginx
before. This is <em>the</em> web server and frontend HTTP loadbalancer all your
HTTP based setups should have anyway. There is documentation in English
on the nginx wiki (<a href="http://wiki.nginx.org">http://wiki.nginx.org</a>)
and if you get stuck there is a lot of stuff just on google. The rails
community love nginx and they tend to document well - a thanks at this
point to those guys.</p>

<p>The setup is really straight forward but has some minor cave eats that
can cause you grief and debugging hours I want to save you.</p>

<p>First of all you need nginx installed on your system - obviously. I
assume that your webroot is under <code>/var/www</code>. We need a directory called
<code>git</code> under it and need to link the repositories in that you want to
share.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>$ mkdir /var/www/git
$ cd /var/www/git
$ ln -s /srv/gitosis/repositories/[repository].git [repository]</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This includes some assumptions. I take that you have more repositories
in your gitosis setup than public repositories you want to share or make
available via http. If this is not the case you can simply point nginx
at your gitosis repository path and add a simple rewrite rule that cuts
off the trailing <code>.git</code> of the repository path.</p>

<p>In nginx we need some configuration that acually serves those
repositories now. That is initially really straight forward:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>server {
    listen   80;
    server_name  git.[your.domain.tld];
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/git.access.log;
    location / {
        root   /var/www/git/;
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This is the first very basic configuration for nginx. All we have to do
now is enabling a simple hook in our git repository we want to serve
and we are done.</p>

<p>To do that we need to go to our gitosis repository (you can simply <code>cd</code> to
the linked directory now) and edit the <code>hooks/post-update</code> hook. Add the
following line (or uncomment it) and make sure the file has the
executable bit set (<code>chmod +x hooks/post-update</code>).</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>exec git-update-server-info</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This post update hook needs to be run once now. You can either push
something to the repository to trigger the hook or <code>su</code> to the git user
and simply run the hook. The <code>su</code> is important to not screw up the
permissions.</p>

<p>Speaking of permissions - we need to make the repository readable by the
nginx user. The easy way is to add <code>www-data</code> to the git group that owns
the git repository. The git group should only have read access to the
git repositories anyway so it does not open up a too big hole in your
security.</p>

<p>Once all that is done you can test your setup with the following
command:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>git ls-remote
http://git.[your.domain.tld]/[repository] master</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This should come back with something like this:</p>

<p><code>171bb2f12ceb908fd4802857a2f577a1739f8d1f        refs/heads/master</code></p>

<h2>Securing the setup with &#8220;basic auth&#8221; and HTTPS</h2>

<p>Now comes the fun part. After we have this setup up and running we can
start to use it for rollout systems like capistrano and have read only
repositories that we serve via HTTPS and basic auth without the need of
deploying SSH keys all over for access to gitosis.</p>

<p>All we have to do now is change our nginx configuration slightly. We
need to enable HTTPS and we can even have different auth files for
different projects. This might be interesting if you run several
projects on your gitosis host with different committers.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>server {
    listen   443;
    server_name  git.[your.domain.tld];
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/git.access.log;

    ssl  on;
    ssl_certificate  certs/git.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key  certs/git.key;

    ssl_session_timeout  5m;

    ssl_protocols  SSLv2 SSLv3 TLSv1;
    ssl_ciphers  ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers   on;

    location / {
        root   /var/www/git/;
        auth_basic            &quot;Restricted&quot;;
        auth_basic_user_file  conf.d/htpasswd.general;
    }

    location /[repository 1] {
        root   /var/www/git/;
        autoindex  on;
        auth_basic            &quot;Restricted&quot;;
        auth_basic_user_file  conf.d/htpasswd.[group 1];
    }
    location /[repository 2] {
        root   /var/www/git/;
        autoindex  on;
        auth_basic            &quot;Restricted&quot;;
        auth_basic_user_file  conf.d/htpasswd.[group 2];
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Reload your nginx and you have your repositories served up under HTTPS
and only need to create the htaccess files now. This is simply done with
the <code>htaccess</code> program that is part of apache (or the apache utils with
come as a separate package).
Also note that your <code>root</code> directory is always the base git webroot.</p>

<h2>some oddities</h2>

<p>While testing I used self signed certificates and as the host is only
used in non public ways I will stay with them. This caused some googling
however as git came up with the following error:</p>

<p><code>fatal: https://[user:pass@git.host]/[repository]/info/refs download error - SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK.</code></p>

<p>This is due to the self signed cert and has to be overridden with a
environment variable. A simple</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>$ export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true</code></pre>
</div>


<p>did the trick. If you have a rollout user you want this parameter to be
in his <code>.profile</code> or your shell specific equivalent (eg <code>.bashrc</code>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Startup automation - Part 2</h1>

<h2>puppet basics</h2>

<p>In the last part of startup automation I talked you through the basics
of configuring gitosis and the puppet config directory to make
deployment of the config files really easy. Obviously we need some test
clients and a working server now to play. I use parallels for local
development and normally fire up one VM per project. I created an empty
debian VM and just did a <code>apt-get install puppet</code>. This installs all
dependencies and leaves you with a working client.</p>

<h2>create a basic configuration</h2>

<p>we need some basic configuration files before we can start. Use these as
templates, they are more or less standard debian config files so you
might have to tweak paths a bit for your environment:</p>

<p><code>puppet.conf</code></p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ini'>[main]
logdir=/var/log/puppet
vardir=/var/lib/puppet
ssldir=/var/lib/puppet/ssl
rundir=/var/run/puppet
factpath=$vardir/lib/facter
pluginsync=true

[puppetmasterd]
templatedir=/var/lib/puppet/templates</code></pre>
</div>


<p><code>fileserver.conf</code></p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ini'># This file consists of arbitrarily named sections/modules
# defining where files are served from and to whom

# Define a section 'files'
# Adapt the allow/deny settings to your needs. Order
# for allow/deny does not matter, allow always takes precedence
# over deny
[files]
path /etc/puppet/files
#  allow *.example.com
#  deny *.evil.example.com
#  allow 192.168.0.0/24

[plugins]
#  allow *.example.com
#  deny *.evil.example.com
#  allow 192.168.0.0/24</code></pre>
</div>


<p>and a basic <code>manifests/site.pp</code></p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='ruby'># site.pp

filebucket { main: server =&gt; 'YOUR_PUPPET_SERVER_HERE' }

# global defaults
File { backup =&gt; main }
Exec { path =&gt; &quot;/usr/bin:/usr/sbin/:/bin:/sbin&quot; }

Package {
    provider =&gt; $operatingsystem ? {
        debian =&gt; aptitude,
        redhat =&gt; up2date
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Make sure you edit the <code>sites.pp</code> to actually point to your puppet
server. Add those files, commit and push. Then restart your
puppetmasterd on the server.</p>

<p>We need two shells now, one on the server and one on your client. Fire
up your shell on the server and ask the puppetmaster for pending
certificate requests with the <code>puppetca</code> command:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>$ puppetca --list</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This should return with <code>no pending requests</code> message or so.</p>

<p>Fire up the second shell on your client and request a certificate from
your server. We try it interactive first till things go smooth:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>$ puppetd --server YOUR_PUPPET_SERVER --waitforcert 60 --test</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This should come back with an error that the cert could not be issued
yet. This is expected as we have not authorized the client yet. To do so
we hop over to our server console again and issue the puppetca command
again. We should have a pending request now from our test client. Go on
and sign it with</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>$ puppetca --sign CLIENT_NAME</code></pre>
</div>


<p>If you rerun the client now with the same command it should be happy and
report success.</p>
</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Startup automation - Part 1</h1>

<p>Startup automation became a big buzz currently but I think it has always
been key to those who were successful. The speed to market is important
and this is not only true for small companies.</p>

<p>Enough marketing blurb. Truth is we tech guys are lazy and that is a
good habit. Laziness keeps us creative in terms of minimising tasks we
have to do and that means in automating stuff. When you (as the tech
guy) grow a company there are many things only you know and can do. This
is normal. One day your marketing guy wants to release new content not
only once but 5 times and you start to think about a real rollout
process. Tis is not exactly new technology but it keeps you busy for a
while and there is a surprising lack of good tutorials out there.</p>

<p>I played with puppet and gitosis the other day to automate parts of our
environment and came up with the following setup. It runs on a slicehost
slice on debian - being a freebsd and mac guy I can confirm the setup is
not too different on those platforms either :-)</p>

<h2>gitosis</h2>

<p>gitosis is a git hosting platform that uses virtual users and is managed
entirely with git hooks. This is nice as you simply check out the master
repository and add users and repositories there. Really simple, really
effective.
It looks like there is exactly one post in the wild that describes
gitosis setup and that is from 2007 (<a href="http://scie.nti.st/2007/11/14/hosting-git-repositories-the-easy-and-secure-way" title="scie.nti.st">scie.nti.st</a>)</p>

<p>First important thing here is a ssh key. You should have one and used to
use it. If you never heard of ssh keys do your homework first!</p>

<p>The last part of your ssh key is normally username@host. Edit that one
to be only your preferred username - this identifier will be the
reference in your gitosis config for your user.</p>

<p>I started playing with gitosis and came up with the following order:
- install gitosis from your preferred package management system (ports,
  apt, &#8230;)
- copy your ssh public key /tmp on the gitosis host
- initialize the repository
  <div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>$ sudo -H -u gitosis gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_dsa.pub</code></pre>
</div></p>

<ul>
<li><p>clone the new master repository
<div>
<pre><code class='sh'>$ git clone gitosis@GITHOST:gitosis-admin.git</code></pre>
</div></p></li>
<li><p>edit gitosis.conf
<div>
<pre><code class='ini'>[group admin]
members = YOURNAME
writable = puppet</code></pre>
</div></p></li>
<li><p>add the gitosis.conf and commit and push</p></li>
<li>you have successfully created your first step in a working gitosis
setup</li>
<li>create a local repository called puppet (git init &#8230;)</li>
<li><p>tell the git repository where your gitosis server is
<div>
<pre><code class='sh'>$ git remote add origin gitosis@GITHOST:puppet.git</code></pre>
</div></p></li>
<li><p>touch a file (you need to have something in the repository to commit)</p></li>
<li>add and commit the file</li>
<li>push the repository to the gitosis server
<div>
<pre><code class='sh'>$ git push origin master:refs/heads/master</code></pre>
</div></li>
</ul>


<p>After this you have two things - a master gitosis repository for your
git server management and a local puppet repository for your future
puppet setup. This puppet setup does not do anything yet so lets wire
that one up to your puppetmaster. For simplicity I assume that the
gitosis server will also be your puppetmaster. Once the underlying
concept is understood you can easily change the puppetmaster to any
other host by only changing the post commit hook in the according git
repository.</p>

<h2>puppet</h2>

<p>Till now we did not bother finding the filesystem location of our new
gitosis setup. Now we need some git hooks in the puppet repository and
we have to find it. Under debain you can find the gitosis repository
structure in <code>/srv/gitosis</code> and our puppet repository under
<code>/srv/gitosis/repositories/puppet.git</code>.</p>

<p>I started out by creating a <code>bin</code> directory for the gitosis user as I
expect to share some code between different hooks. There will be many
&#8220;check out this repo to this working directory&#8221; hooks for various
purposes. The first script is very basic and does nothing fancy - we can
beef it up later on as we go.</p>

<p><code>/srv/gitosis/bin/update.sh</code></p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>#!/bin/sh
umask 002

PFAD=$1
CURR=`pwd`
cd ${PFAD}

env -i /usr/bin/git-pull origin master
env -i git-update-server-info
cd ${CURR}</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This simple script takes one argument which is the destination path and
doe a git pull there. Very generic and not too secure but it does the
trick for the beginning.</p>

<p>Now we need to make this script executable and add it to the
post-receive git hook in the puppet repository. Go to
<code>/srv/gitosis/repositories/puppet.git/hooks</code> and edit the <code>post-receive</code>
hook. We only need the following line in there for the moment:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>~/bin/update.sh /etc/puppet</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This calls our shiny update script we wrote moments ago. Make sure the
hook script is executable. Now we start setting up puppet. Make sure you
installed puppetmasterd via your favorite package management system. In case you
have a working puppet setup already make sure you back up all your
configuration files. I assume there is nothing here yet and we can axe
the existing stuff and start from scratch.</p>

<p>Remove the existing <code>/etc/puppet</code> directory and clone our repository
here.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>$ cd /etc
$ rm -rf puppet
$ git clone /srv/gitosis/repositories/puppet.git
$ chmod -R g+w puppet</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Now we have to modify two hooks to make sure we fix permissions. This is
a ugly hack and only gets us started for now - this should really be
done nicer later on. Edit in the puppet directory under <code>.git/hooks</code> the
file <code>post-merge</code> and add the following:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='sh'>#!/bin/sh

echo &quot;granting rights in `pwd`&quot;
sudo chown -R root:root /etc/puppet</code></pre>
</div>


<p>To make this work you need to make sure that the gitosis user is in your
sodoers file and of course that sudo is installed. Make this file
executable and copy it to the <code>post-checkout</code> hook.</p>

<p>Nearly there, test it now and see if you get errors when you push puppet
configuration to the server. If all goes well you should see the puppet
config hitting your <code>/etc/puppet</code> directory on the server right after
you pushed your local repository.</p>

<p>How to set up a basic puppet infrastructure will be covered in the next
part of this series. Stay tuned &#8230;</p>
